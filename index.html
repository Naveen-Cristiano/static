Let me know if you want a roadmap, weekly study plan, or want me to prepare hands-on tasks to master these. I can customize it to your current learning pace.

Great question — and I appreciate your sharp observation!

You're right: many of the services listed above are ones you've already explored, but here's the honest breakdown:


---

Did I base it only on what you've asked?

No — I used:

1. Your questions to understand your depth.


2. Industry-standard expectations for AWS Admins with 3–4 years experience.


3. Real-world tasks seen in production environments (including enterprise and mid-size companies).


4. AWS certification blueprints (like SysOps Admin and Solutions Architect).




---

So, are those all the services an AWS Admin should know?

YES — for a practical and real-world AWS Admin role, those are the core services and tasks you need to master.
However, depending on the company, size, and use-case, you might optionally be asked to handle more. Here’s a list of additional, role-expanding services:


---

Optional but Beneficial (Advanced Admin or transitioning to DevOps)

Category	Service	Why Learn It

Backup & DR	AWS Backup	Centralized backup across EBS, RDS, EFS, DynamoDB
Security	GuardDuty, Security Hub	Threat detection & compliance dashboard
Patch Automation	Systems Manager Patch Manager	Automate patching EC2s
Compliance Auditing	AWS Config	Track config changes, compliance rules
Networking Advanced	Transit Gateway, VPC Lattice	Manage large network topologies
IAM Advanced	SCPs, IAM Access Analyzer, SSO	Multi-account, org-wide access controls
Automation	CloudFormation or Terraform	Infrastructure as Code
Event Management	EventBridge	Automate workflows (e.g., notify on EC2 stop)
Container Basics	ECS or EKS (Fargate)	Many companies now use containers
CI/CD Deeper	CodeBuild, CodePipeline	Automate testing + deployments
Cost Optimization	Compute Optimizer, Trusted Advisor	Save money, avoid wastage



---

TL;DR

Yes, the list I gave earlier is accurate and complete for a solid AWS Admin role with 3–4 years experience.

You’ve already covered a great amount of it hands-on.

If you aim to transition to DevOps/Solutions Architect, you’ll want to learn the advanced tools listed above.



---

Want me to now prepare a role-specific skill tracker table or a visual mind map of all services with priority labels like:

[Core]

[Recommended]

[Optional]
?


Fantastic — this is one of the most frequently debated topics when it comes to AWS Admin roles.


---

TL;DR:

ECS/EKS are not core daily responsibilities for a traditional AWS Administrator — but if you're working in a DevOps-heavy, modern infrastructure, you’re expected to at least understand and support ECS.
EKS is more specialized and usually handled by DevOps or Platform Engineers.


---

Let’s break it down:

Cluster Service	Required for Admin?	Typical Role

ECS (Elastic Container Service)	Yes – Light to Moderate	You may deploy or monitor container tasks
EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)	No – Optional/Advanced	Usually DevOps/Kubernetes specialists



---

What an AWS Admin Should Know about ECS:

Task	Examples

Understand ECS Cluster vs Task vs Service	What is launched and where
Deploy containers using EC2 or Fargate	Basic Docker/container familiarity
Update task definitions	To change image or environment vars
Logging via CloudWatch	Check container failures
Security Group, Role Assignment	IAM role for Task Execution
Load Balancer integration	ALB path-based routing to ECS services
Service Auto Scaling	ECS service → adjust task count based on CPU/memory


> These are all manageable with minimal DevOps knowledge, especially if ECS Fargate is used (no cluster mgmt).




---

What about EKS (Kubernetes)?

Consideration	Admin View

Requires Kubernetes knowledge	Not expected for standard Admins
Complex networking & RBAC setup	Needs in-depth platform expertise
Hands-on with kubectl, Helm, YAML manifests	Not day-to-day Admin task
Very common in DevOps/SRE roles	Optional for Admin unless cross-skilling


> You should know what EKS is and its position in the architecture, but you’re not expected to manage it unless you're growing into DevOps or Cloud Engineer.




---

Summary:

Platform	Must-Know Level for AWS Admin	Comments

ECS (Fargate)	Yes – Deployment, Task Definition, ALB Integration	Especially in containerized apps
EKS	Optional – Awareness is good, hands-on if transitioning to DevOps	Managed by container specialists or DevOps



---

Want me to prepare a hands-on flow like:

Create ECS service with 2 containers

Route with ALB

Push new version via GitHub or CLI
?
That would give you real confidence from Admin point-of-view.


Excellent follow-up — and you're right to question this.

TL;DR

SQS and SNS are not usually part of an AWS Admin's daily core responsibilities, but they should be understood well enough to troubleshoot, monitor, and support them when used in your project.


---

Here’s the honest breakdown:

1. AWS Administrator – Primary Focus:

Core Responsibilities	Example

EC2, VPC, S3, IAM, SG/NACLs, Route Tables, EBS, ALB/NLB, Auto Scaling	Launch, secure, and scale infrastructure
Systems Manager, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, Backups, AMIs	Monitoring, patching, logging, automation
CodeDeploy/SSM/Automation for software rollouts	App deployment & maintenance
IAM roles/policies, cost alerts, billing alerts	Access + cost mgmt


2. SQS and SNS – When an Admin Must Care:

When to care	Why it matters for Admin

An app is failing to process messages from SQS	You might need to check DLQ (dead letter queue), retry logic, or permissions
SNS topic not triggering Lambda/Email/SQS properly	Admins may need to check subscriptions, permissions, region issues
CodePipeline triggers SNS notifications on deploy	Admins should verify SNS access & delivery
S3 → Event Notification → SQS/SNS → Lambda	Admin may configure the S3 event or the permissions/policy side of SQS



---

Real-World Scenarios:

You might not write the code to publish messages to SNS or poll SQS, but:

You create the policy to allow Lambda to read from SQS.

You verify that the correct endpoint is subscribed to SNS.

You troubleshoot why messages aren’t flowing through the pipeline.




---

Verdict:

Role	Expected SQS/SNS Knowledge

AWS Admin (3–4 yrs)	Understand integration patterns, be able to read/debug JSON policies, enable logging/metrics
DevOps Engineer	Automate setup with IaC, connect queues to microservices, tune visibility/timeout settings
Developer	Publishes/consumes messages, codes retry logic
